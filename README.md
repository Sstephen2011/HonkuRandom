# HonkuRandom
## Homemade chess engine which plays random moves.

This is a chess engine made completely with python, and the random module in python. 
It is UCI Compatible, and it is hosted on lichess @HonkuRandom [https://lichess.org/@/HonkuRandom]
It only plays casual moves.
I've added chat.py, which sends random Sun Tzu Quotes.
